Changes in Version 1.3

1. New proposal schema including all the information requested by the grants office.

2. Updates to proposal_member_view.pt to simplify, show the additional data and make the status of the proposal show up for the proposer.

3. Added content rule to move all proposals to the proposals folder.  There is a problem.  The proposal folder is not created if it doesn't exist.  This does allow loading of an update onto a site with an existing proposals folder, but throws and error when installing on a completely blank plone site.

4. Updated review form vocabularies to the 5 point scale.

5. Removed all the tabs.  Director tools contains links for many of these and the rest are replaced with links to searches in portlets for appropriate users.  I cannot get portlets to install.

Changes in Version 1.2

1. Changed templates of listing proposals for displaying the proposals from the root.

2. Added script to change the ownership of the Review forms if they are manually created by the director.

3. Added Object action to runt he change ownership script

4. Changed permissions and assigned new permissions to Director to sun the scripts.
